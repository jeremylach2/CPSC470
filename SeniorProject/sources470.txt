1) "There is no consensus in the discipline as to what
characteristic features to use or what methodology or
techniques to apply in standard research, which is
precisely the greatest problem confronting stylometry." Pg 1 Features
2) Can use winnowing to lessen the number of features 
3) Can use boosting methods
4) "They are especially good in situations where
the “concept” to be learned is very difficult to express as a
well-defined, simple formulation, but rather is a complex,
highly interrelated function of the inputs which is usually
not easily transparent. This feature makes them ideal to
learn a concept like “style” which is inherently intangible" Neural Networks

1) style inputs could include: "lexical (character based and word-based features), syntactic (function words and PoS), 
	structural (paragraphs and greetings) and content based features (content words)." Pg. 116
Examples (Pg 120): count for puncuation, word n-grams, character n-grams, style words, word ending

1) function words might not work when comparing multiple authors Pg. 513
2) Authorship verification is better for limited data situations, "Did candidate author x write the document?" Pg. 514
3) The authors want more research into eager learning methods (Maximum Entropy Leanring, SVM) Pg.517
